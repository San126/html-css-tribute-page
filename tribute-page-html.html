        <li>
          George Herbert Leigh-Mallory was born at Newton Hall, Mobberley, Cheshire, on 18 June 1886 as the first son
          and second child of the Reverend Herbert Leigh Mallory, rector of the parish.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was an English mountaineer who participated in the first three British Mount Everest expeditions from the
          early to mid-1920s.
        </li>
        <li>
          At age seven, his first venture into climbing was the roof of his father's church, St Wilfrid's, in Mobberley.
          His sister Avie recalls, "He climbed everything that it was at all possible to climb". Included in his
          climbing escapades were the drainpipes of the Mallory home, Hobcroft House, and the walls that divided the
          farmers' fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mallory won a mathematics scholarship to Winchester College, Hampshire, where he started as a mathematical
          scholar in September 1900. At Winchester, he was proficient at sports, in addition to his academic excellence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Irving recruited Mallory and his fellow pupil and friend, Harry Olivier Sumner Gibson, for a trip to the Alps.
          In early August 1904, Irving, Mallory, and Gibson travelled to the Alps, for Mallory's first foray into
          high-altitude mountaineering.
        </li>
        <li>In October 1905, at the start of the Michaelmas term, Mallory entered Magdalene College to study history
          under A. C. Benson, the newly appointed supervisor in history at the college.</li>
        <li>
          On 29 July 1914, six days before Britain entered the First World War, Mallory and Ruth were married in
          Godalming with Mallory's father performing the ceremony and Geoffrey Winthrop Young acting as best man.
          Mallory and Ruth had two daughters and a son: Frances Clare (1915–2001), Beridge Ruth, known as "Berry"
          (1917–1953) and John (1920–2011).
        </li>
        <li>
          In December 1915, Mallory joined the Royal Garrison Artillery as 2nd lieutenant and in 1916 participated in
          the shelling of the Somme, under the command of Major Gwilym Lloyd George, son of then Prime Minister David
          Lloyd George.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the war, he returned to Charterhouse, resigning in 1921 to participate in the first Everest expedition.
        </li>
        <li> At the end of March 1924, all expedition members were assembled and the journey to Mount Everest began.
        </li>
        <li>
          On 1 June 1924 Mallory and Bruce began their first attempt from the North Col, supported by nine "tiger"
          porters. Camp IV was situated in a relatively protected space some 50 metres (160 ft) below the lip of the
          North Col; when they left the shelter of the ice walls they were exposed to harsh, icy winds sweeping across
          the North Face. Before they were able to install Camp V at 7,681 metres (25,200 ft), four porters abandoned
          their loads and turned back.
        </li>
        <li>
          During this solo climb, Somervell took one of the most remarkable photographs in mountaineering history. It
          shows Norton near his high point of 8,572.8 metres (28,126 ft) where he tried to climb over steep, icy terrain
          with some spots of fresh snow. This altitude established a confirmed world record climbing altitude which was
          not surpassed for another 28 years; the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, when Raymond Lambert and Tenzing
          Norgay reached 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) on the south side of Everest
        </li>
        <li>
          During the final summit attempt of the 1924 expedition,Mallory and his climbing partner, Andrew Irvine,
          disappeared high on the northeast ridge.
        </li>

      <p id="quote"><i>“If one should ask me what "use" there was in climbing, or attempting to climb the world's highest peak, I would be compelled to answer "none." There is no scientific end to be served; simply the gratification of the impulse of achievement, the indomitable desire to see what lies beyond the heart of man.”</i></p>
